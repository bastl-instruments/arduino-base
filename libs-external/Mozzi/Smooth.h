/** A simple infinite impulse response low pass filter for smoothing control or audio signals. 
This algorithm comes from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter: 
y[i] := y[i-1] + Î± * (x[i] - y[i-1]), 
translated as 
out = last_out + a * (in - last_out). 
It's not calibrated to any real-world update rate, so if you use it at
CONTROL_RATE and you change CONTROL_RATE, you'll need to adjust the smoothness
value to suit.
@tparam T the type of numbers being smoothed.  Watch out for numbers overflowing the
internal calculations. Some experimentation is recommended.
@note Timing: ~5us for 16 bit types, ~1us for 8 bit types.
@todo Check if 8 bit templates can work efficiently with a higher res smoothness -
	as is they don't have enough resolution to work well at audio rate.  See if Line might be
	more useful in most cases.
