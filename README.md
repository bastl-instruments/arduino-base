    |   |
    |   libs-bastl
    |       |
    |	    bastl
    |       |
    |       ..other library repositories from bastl instruments
    | 
    SEKVOJ
    |
    ..other device specific projects
</code>

* Import arduino-base and the device projects in Eclipse by right-clicking in the project explorer and choosing
    Import > Existing projects into workspace

### 4. Set up Serial connector

Install drivers
look up device by
  ls /dev | grep tty
